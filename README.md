# OncoML

OncoML is a machine learning project for breast cancer risk prediction
using diagnostic features extracted from biopsy images.

The goal of this project is to build a reliable baseline classification
model that can distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.



##  Model

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (Linear Kernel)
- Task: Binary Classification
- Target: Diagnosis (Malignant / Benign)



##  Data Processing

- 30 numeric diagnostic features
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Train-test split to avoid data leakage
